        Welcome to the Jaseci Conversational AI Personality Test! This project was created as part of the Jaseci AI apprenticeship program. It uses the Myers-Briggs model to determine the personality traits of an individual based on their responses to questions. The personality type is then identified by a code that is derived from these traits.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes this personality test unique? This personality test provides users with a conversational experience, almost as if they are talking to another human! Some users may find it challenging to complete other personality tests that require them to assess statements on a scale based on whether they agree or disagree. This personality test, on the other hand, gives individuals the ability to respond as they like, for instance, in sentences or phrases. Even verbal responses are possible! The app then converts these responses into numbers, which are then used to compute the personality type.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project consists of two interfaces: Admin and User.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Admin interface caters to leaders of companies, for example, or just about anyone who wishes to create their own test for others. Here, the individual can create, edit, or delete questions. Although a field is provided to select the category of the questions, the USE QA module from the Jaseci kit is used to determine the category and subcategory. This interface also shows all the responses and a summary of each respondent's traits. For privacy reasons, the actual answers given by the respondents have been omitted. Additionally, the home page shows a summary of all the data, represented by various graphs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The individual taking the test is presented with a chatbot-like interface. The questions are those created by the admin. The answers provided by the user are converted to a scale of 1 to 5, which is then added to calculate the percentage for each personality trait and, by extension, the respondent's personality type.
